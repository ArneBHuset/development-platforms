## Introduction

Microsoft Azure, most often refered to as Azure, is a cloud computing platform, created by Microsoft. Im broad terms, Azures offers tools and services to help businesses and individuals manage and enahance their digital operations. The platform consists of more then 200 products meant for building, testing, deploying and managing applications and services, all utilizng cloud technology. In this case study, we will dive deeper into the this technology, it's history, background, features and market comparison. We wil also dive into how to utlize and setup the technology.  

## Brief History

You may use a bullet point list or subheadings to structure a timeline of your chosen topic's history:
- 2008: Microsoft Azure is announced as a competitor to Amazon EC2 and Google App Engine.
- 2010: Azure becomes commercially available.
- 2011: The concept of "infrastrucutre as a service" (IaaS) is introduced, allowing users to run virtual machines on the cloud. 
- 2012: Windows Azure Websites was annonced, allowing developers to build sites using ASP.NET, PHP, Node.js or Pyhthon and easily deploy them to the cloud. 
- 2014: Windows Azure was rebranded Microsoft Azure to reflect the growing capabilities beyond Windows. 
- 2016: Azure stack is announced, allowing organizations to run Azure services from the own data centers. 
- 2017: Axure Comsos DB, a globally distributed, multi-model databse service was announced. 
- 2018: Azure kubernetes services (AKS) was announced, offering managed Kubernetes on Azure. Confidential computing was made available, adding new data security technologies. 
- 2019: Microsoft announced Azure Blockchain Service, making it simpler to deploy secure blockchain networks
- 2020: New AI-driven data analytics platform called Azure Synapse Analaytics was introduced. 
- 2021: Microsoft Mesh was announced, offering mixed realtiy capabilities integrated with Azure. 
- 2022: Azure OpenAI was launched. Integrating AI models like GPT-3 into its cloud offering
- 2023: More advanced AI and machine learning tools are made available. Increased efforts in Azures sustainability efforts, including tools to measure and manage carbon emissions. 
- 2024: Ongoing plans to moce Azure's global infrastrucutre towards, and further integrating is with quantom computing technologies. 

## Bacground

To understand Microsfot Azure, one has to understand the term cloud computing in corrolation with computer science. 

Cloud computing includes several computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software analytics and intelligence organized over the internet instead of local datacenters and servers. Utilizing cloud echnology have proven benefitial in several aspects.

COST
Companies that have moved to cloud solutions have a lower IT cost, seeing as they dont need to buy hardware and software for onsite datacenters. 

SCALEABILITY
It is far easier to scale your software and business more rapidly using the cloud. One can easily adjust the amount of computing power, storage and bandwith needed, for the right need. 

SPEED
The speed of cloud computing has significnatly accelerated the pace of technological innovation. This is due to the possability to quickly iterate on applications more quickly without having to change hardware. 

PERFORMANCE
Cloud computing services are regurarly updated to the latest generation. This ensures the fastest available commuting power. 

SECURITY
Most cloud technologies have implemented policies and systems designed to ensure that data, apps and infrastructure is protected from threats. 


Not all cloud soltions are the same. We can differ between public-, private-, and hybrid clouds. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud, delivering computing resources for customers but managed and owned by Microsoft themselves. A private cloud however, would be a cloud deployed and maintained from a private datacentre. THe main benefit from this would be more control of the cloud environment and the possability fo higher levels of security. The hybrid ooption would be a combination of these two. 

Furthermore, we can differ between four types of cloud services:
IaaS
PaaS
Serverless
Saas
